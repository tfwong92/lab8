            <h2>About this survey</h2>

            <p>The Intell Unit of the <a href="http://www.tncpi.upm.edu.my"> Office of the Deputy Vice Chancellor
                    (Research and Innovation)</a> is conducting a study on the relationship between the UPM
                researchers’ disciplines and their intended socio-economic impacts. Under the <a
                        href="http://mrdcs.mastic.gov.my/">R&D Classification System by MOSTI (2011)</a>,
                “discipline” is classified as “Fields of Research” or (FOR) and socio-economic impact as
                Socio-Economic Objective (SEO). The relationship between FOR and SEO as perceived by the UPM
                researchers, may indicate UPM’s contribution to the society.

            <h2>MRDCS</h2>

            <p>The <a href="http://mrdcs.mastic.gov.my/">Malaysian Research and Development Classification System
                    (MRDCS)</a> is a set of classifications
                designed for use in the measurement and analysis of research and development (R&D) activities in
                Malaysia.</p>
            <h4>Field of Research</h4>

            <p><em>Field of Research (FOR)</em> represents R&D activities classified according to their
                scientific and academic disciplines. These disciplines tend to be universally
                applicable, with national variations arising from the grouping of different research
                fields.</p>
            <h4>Socio-Economic Objective</h4>

            <p><em>Socio Economic Objective (SEO)</em> allows R&D activities to be categorised
                according to their purposes or presumed sectoral benefits as perceived by the
                researchers. It consists of discrete economical, social, environmental, technological
                or scientific domain for identifying the principal purpose of the R&D. This system
                shows greater national variation according to a nation’s profile and development
                priorities.</p>
